# Mini Python Compiler 

A mini Python compiler written in C++ with flex and bison. 

Should be working. There are some tests in the `./tests/` folder. 

Migrated the features from the previous assignment, including inline if, repeat until, elif chain, and some other operators. 

It successfully understands scopes. Therefore, new variables created in, say, if statements will not be visible outside of the statements.
