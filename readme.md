Should be working. There are some tests in the `./tests/` folder. 

Migrated the features from the previous assignment, including inline if, repeat until, elif chain, and some other operators. 

I did the bonus one for the scope. My implementation is kinda weird though. But it does the job I think. 

Modified the output messages after due date.
